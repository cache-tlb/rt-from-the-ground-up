what is done:

mirror reflect

glossy specular

texture mapping (not very well)

noise texture

-------------------------------
problems:



SV_Lambertian::sample_f is not implemented actually, neither is Lambertian::sample_f.

some problem in Instance::~Instance(), should the pointer be released ?

some problem with ImageTexture::image_ptr, should it be released when replaced ?

noise in area light

sampler pointer is not initially set in ViewPlane

should add an io manager in class Grid

problem in compound::set_material

!! a fundamental problem: should Shape release material_ptr in destruction?

pinhole camera's sampling

-------------------------------
TODO:
turbulence noise has not been implemented yet
