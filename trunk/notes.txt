what is done:

mirror reflect

glossy specular

texture mapping (not very well)

noise texture

fixed wrong normal in axisaligned box, normal should point outside

9.10: added function get_bounding_box in class Axisaligned_box
      fixed some bugs in Thinlens
      added function shadow_hit in class Instance

-------------------------------
problems:



SV_Lambertian::sample_f is not implemented actually, neither is Lambertian::sample_f.

some problem in Instance::~Instance(), should the pointer be released ?

some problem with ImageTexture::image_ptr, should it be released when replaced ?

noise in area light

sampler pointer is not initially set in ViewPlane

problem in compound::set_material

!! a fundamental problem: should Shape release material_ptr in destruction?

pinhole camera's sampling

should object pointers in class Compound be shared

class Grid's copy constructor has not been implemented.

-------------------------------
TODO:
turbulence noise has not been implemented yet

transparent material is the brdf  -> ok

tir and sample_f function in transmitted btdf -> ok
